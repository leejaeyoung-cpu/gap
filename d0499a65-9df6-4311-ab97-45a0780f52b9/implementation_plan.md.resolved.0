# Implementation Plan: Visual Assets for AI Anticancer Drug Combination System

## Overview
Creating 10 detailed images and 12 tables for the AI-based anticancer drug combination system research paper.

## Current Status
- **Issue**: Cannot access the HWP file "인공지능 기반 항암제 정밀 조합 시스템.hwp" as it's in Downloads directory (outside workspace)
- **Alternative**: The user has `AI_Anticancer_System_SCI_Paper_Complete.md` open in Downloads
- **Available Reference**: Previous work on [AI_Anticancer_Cocktail_Paper_KR_Full.txt](file:///c:/Users/brook/Desktop/%ED%95%AD%EC%95%94%EC%A0%9C%20%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8/%ED%95%AD%EC%95%94%EC%A0%9C%20%EC%B9%B5%ED%85%8C%EC%9D%BC/AI_Anticancer_Cocktail_Paper_KR_Full.txt) in the workspace

## User Decision Required

### Option 1: Copy HWP File to Workspace
Copy `인공지능 기반 항암제 정밀 조합 시스템.hwp` to:
```
c:\Users\brook\Desktop\항암제 프로그램\항암제 칵테일\
```

### Option 2: Disable Workspace Validation
Allow access to Downloads directory to read the markdown file directly.

### Option 3: Work from Existing Materials
Use the existing Korean paper ([AI_Anticancer_Cocktail_Paper_KR_Full.txt](file:///c:/Users/brook/Desktop/%ED%95%AD%EC%95%94%EC%A0%9C%20%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%A8/%ED%95%AD%EC%95%94%EC%A0%9C%20%EC%B9%B5%ED%85%8C%EC%9D%BC/AI_Anticancer_Cocktail_Paper_KR_Full.txt)) as the basis for creating visual assets.

## Proposed Visual Assets (10 Images)

Based on typical AI anticancer research papers, the 10 images should include:

### 1. **System Architecture Diagram**
- Overall AI system framework
- Data flow: Clinical data → Cellpose analysis → Drug recommendation
- Integration points between components

### 2. **Cellpose Cell Segmentation Workflow**
- Before/after image comparison
- Vector flow visualization
- Feature extraction process

### 3. **Neural Network Architecture**
- Multi-modal input fusion
- Hidden layers structure
- Output: Efficacy, Synergy, Toxicity scores

### 4. **Model Performance Comparison**
- Bar chart: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, Ensemble
- Accuracy metrics (already created: 92.4% ensemble)

### 5. **Drug Synergy Heatmap**
- Matrix showing synergy scores between drug pairs
- Color-coded: Green (synergistic), Yellow (additive), Red (antagonistic)

### 6. **Clinical Trial Results - Efficacy**
- Box plots comparing FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, FOLFOX+Pritamab, FOLFIRI+Pritamab
- Statistical significance markers

### 7. **Toxicity Profile Comparison**
- Radar chart showing different toxicity types
- Comparison between standard therapy and AI-recommended therapy

### 8. **Patient Subgroup Analysis**
- Forest plot showing hazard ratios
- Subgroups: Age, KRAS status, Cancer stage, ECOG status

### 9. **ROC Curves for Prediction Models**
- Multiple ROC curves for efficacy, synergy, toxicity predictions
- AUC values displayed

### 10. **Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves**
- Progression-free survival (PFS)
- Overall survival (OS)
- Comparison of treatment groups

---

## Proposed Data Tables (12 Tables)

### 1. **Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics**
- Age, Gender, Cancer type, Stage, ECOG status
- Sample size breakdown

### 2. **Drug Database Specifications**
- Drug names, Mechanisms of action, FDA approval status
- Base efficacy and toxicity scores

### 3. **Cellpose Analysis Parameters**
- Diameter, Flow threshold, Cell probability threshold
- Processing time comparison (CPU vs GPU)

### 4. **Extracted Cell Features**
- Feature name, Calculation formula, Normal range, Cancer range

### 5. **Model Hyperparameters**
- Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network settings
- Training parameters, Validation strategy

### 6. **Model Performance Metrics**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC
- For each model variant

### 7. **Drug Combination Results - FOLFOX Group**
- Efficacy, Synergy, Toxicity, Overall score
- Standard vs Pritamab-enhanced

### 8. **Drug Combination Results - FOLFIRI Group**
- Same metrics as Table 7

### 9. **Subgroup Analysis Results**
- Efficacy by patient characteristics
- Interaction p-values

### 10. **Adverse Events Comparison**
- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
- Grade 3/4 toxicities frequency

### 11. **Computational Performance Benchmarks**
- Processing time, Memory usage, GPU utilization
- Scalability metrics

### 12. **Comparison with Existing AI Systems**
- System name, Accuracy, Data modalities used
- Benchmarking against published methods

## Technical Approach

### Image Generation Strategy
Since Photoshop cannot be directly controlled via API, I will:

1. **Generate Python-based visualizations** using:
   - Matplotlib for charts and plots
   - Seaborn for statistical visualizations
   - Plotly for interactive elements (exported as static PNG)
   - NetworkX for system diagrams

2. **Create high-resolution outputs**:
   - 300 DPI for publication quality
   - Large canvas sizes (3000x2000 pixels minimum)
   - Professional color schemes (Nature/Science journal style)

3. **Provide Photoshop-ready assets**:
   - Save as layered PSD files where possible
   - Include separate PNG exports
   - Provide editable SVG where applicable

### Table Generation Strategy
1. **Create detailed CSV/Excel files**
2. **Generate formatted table images** using:
   - Matplotlib table rendering
   - Pandas styling for professional appearance
3. **Export in multiple formats**:
   - PNG for embedding
   - LaTeX format for academic publishing
   - Excel for data editing

## Next Steps

**Waiting for user decision** on how to proceed with accessing the source document.

Once source material is accessible:
1. Analyze document structure
2. Extract data points for each table
3. Design visual style guide
4. Generate all 10 images
5. Create all 12 tables
6. Package for delivery
